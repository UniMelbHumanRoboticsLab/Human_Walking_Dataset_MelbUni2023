This repository includes custom Matlab (.m) scripts that can be used to run basic calculations, visualisation, and data analysis using human walking data
available from an [open access data repository](https://springernature.figshare.com/...). More details on how data were collected, what data are available,
and structure of the provided dataset can be found in the corresponding [data descriptor paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/...). 

Data are provided on two different levels -- raw and segmented, and in two different formats: .c3d and .mat. The organisation is as follows:
1. RAW: raw data comes in both .c3d and .mat formats.
  1. C3D format: 
  2. MAT format:
